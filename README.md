# Portfolio Optimization

This Google Colab notebook implements a Markowitz-style portfolio optimization using historical stock data from Yahoo Finance. It demonstrates how to construct several optimal portfolios based on expected returns, risk (volatility), Sharpe ratio and Sortino ratio using Python tools like NumPy and SciPy.

# Features

* Data Download via yFinance: Retrieves historical daily closing prices of selected stocks.
* Return and Risk Calculation: Computes log returns, expected portfolio returns, and volatility.
* Efficient Frontier: Generates random portfolios and plots the risk-return trade-off.
* Optimal portfolios identification and visualization
	
# What I Learned!

* Modern Portfolio Theory: Practical application of Markowitz's framework for diversification and risk-return optimization.
* Numerical Optimization: Used scipy.optimize.minimize to maximize Sharpe ratio and minimize volatility.
* Financial Data Handling: Downloaded, cleaned, and processed financial time series for analysis.
